## Resources:
1. Data:
   departments.csv
   dept_emp.csv
   dept_manager.csv
   employees.csv
   salaries.csv
   titles.csv
2. Software:

28255	Senior Staff
14221	Engineer
12242	Staff
4502	Technique Leader
1761	Assistant Engineer

## Challenge Summary:

We can see from the data that there will be a very high volume of retirees in the near future. With this in mind, we will want to start mentoring younger employees as well as possibly look at hiring new employees to bring in also. This will help to ensure we have employees in place, prior to the large volume of retirements we will be seeing in the near future.
